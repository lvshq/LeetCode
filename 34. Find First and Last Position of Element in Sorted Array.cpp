/*
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

/*
Time complexity : O(log10(n))
Because binary search cuts the search space roughly in half on each iteration, 
there can be at most log10(n) â€‹iterations.
Binary search is invoked twice, so the overall complexity is logarithmic.

Space complexity : O(1)
All work is done in place, so the overall memory usage is constant.

    Application of modified Binary Search.
    Pay attention to the change of [left] and [right]. They must change otherwise mid will stay unchanged.
